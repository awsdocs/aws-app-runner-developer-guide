# The App Runner API<a name="api"></a>

The AWS App Runner application programming interface \(API\) is a RESTful API for making requests to the App Runner service\. You can use the API to create, list, describe, update, and delete App Runner resources in your AWS account\.

You can call the API directly in your application code, or you can use one of the AWS SDKs\. For command line scripts, use the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/) to make calls to the App Runner service\. For more information about AWS developer tools, see [Tools to Build on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/)\.
