# Creating an App Runner service<a name="manage-create"></a>

AWS App Runner automates the process of going from a container image or a source code repository to a running web service that scales automatically\. You point App Runner to your source image or code, specifying only a small number of required settings\. App Runner builds your application if needed, provisions compute resources, and deploys your application to run on them\.

When you create a service, App Runner creates a *service* resource\. In some cases, you might need to provide a *connection* resource\. If you use the App Runner console, the console implicitly creates the connection resource\. For details about App Runner resource types, see [App Runner resources](architecture.md#architecture.resources)\. These resource types have quotas that are associated with your account in each AWS Region\. For more information, see [App Runner resource quotas](architecture.md#architecture.quotas)\.

There are subtle differences in the procedure for creating a service depending on the source type and provider\. This topic shows entirely separate procedures for creating these different source types so that you can follow whichever one best matches your situation\. For a basic starting procedure with a code example, see [Getting started with App Runner](getting-started.md)\.

## Prerequisites<a name="manage-create.prereq"></a>

Before you create your App Runner service, be sure to complete the following actions:
+ Complete the setup steps in [Setting up for App Runner](setting-up.md)\.
+ Have your application source ready\. You can use either a code repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/) or a container image in [Amazon Elastic Container Registry \(Amazon ECR\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/) to create an App Runner service\.

## Create a service<a name="manage-create.create"></a>

This section walks through the creation process for the two App Runner service types: based on source code, and based on a container image\.

### Create a service from a GitHub code repository<a name="manage-create.create.github"></a>

The following sections show how to create an App Runner service when your source is a code repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/)\. When you use GitHub, App Runner has to connect to the GitHub organization or account\. Therefore, you need to help establish this connection\. For more information about App Runner connections, see [Managing App Runner connections](manage-connections.md)\.

When you create the service, App Runner builds a Docker image containing your application code and dependencies\. It then launches a service that runs a container instance of this image\.

#### Creating a service from code using the App Runner console<a name="manage-create.create.github.console"></a>

**To create an App Runner service using the console**

1. Configure your source code\.

   1. Open the [App Runner console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner), and in the **Regions** list, select your AWS Region\.

   1. If the AWS account doesn't have any App Runner services yet, the console home page is displayed\. Choose **Create an App Runner service**\.  
![\[App Runner console home page showing the create service button\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/images/getting-started-home.png)

      If the AWS account has existing services, the **Services** page with a list of your services is displayed\. Choose **Create service**\.  
![\[App Runner console services page\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/images/getting-started-services.png)

   1. On the **Source and deployment** page, in the **Source** section, for **Repository type**, choose **Source code repository**\.

   1. For **Connect to GitHub**, select a GitHub account or organization that you've used before, or choose **Add new**\. Then, go through the process of providing your GitHub credentials and choosing a GitHub account or organization to connect to\.

   1. For **Repository**, select the repository that contains your application code\.

   1. For **Branch**, select the branch that you want to deploy\.

1. Configure your deployments\.

   1. In the **Deployment settings** section, choose **Manual** or **Automatic**\.

1. Configure the application build\.

   1. On the **Configure build** page, for **Configuration file**, choose **Configure all settings here** if your repository doesn't contain an App Runner configuration file, or **Use a configuration file** if it does\.
**Note**  
An App Runner configuration file is a way to maintain your build configuration as part of your application source\. When you provide one, App Runner reads some values from the file and doesn't let you set them in the console\.

   1. Provide the following build settings:
      + **Runtime** – Choose a specific managed runtime for your application\.
      + **Build command** – Enter a command that builds your application from its source code\. This might be a language\-specific tool or a script provided with your code\.
      + **Start command** – Enter the command that starts your web service\.
      + **Port** – Enter the IP port that your web service listens to\.

   1. Choose **Next**\.  
![\[Build settings while creating an App Runner service\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/images/getting-started-create-build.png)

1. Configure your service\.

   1. On the **Configure service** page, in the **Service settings** section, enter a service name\.
**Note**  
All other service settings are either optional or have console\-provided defaults\.

   1. Optionally change or add other settings to meet your application requirements\.

   1. Choose **Next**\.

   Result: If service creation succeeds, the console should show the service dashboard, with a **Service overview** of the new service\.  
![\[App Runner service dashboard page\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/images/getting-started-create-dashboard.png)

1. Verify that your service is running\.

   1. On the service dashboard page, wait until the service **Status** is **Running**\.

   1. Choose the **Default domain** value—it's the URL to your service's website\.

   1. Use your website and verify that it's running properly\.

#### Creating a service from code using the App Runner API or AWS CLI<a name="manage-create.create.github.api"></a>

To create a service using the App Runner API or AWS CLI, call the `CreateService` API action\. For more information and an example, see [CreateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_CreateService.html)\. If this is the first time you're creating a service using a specific GitHub organization or account, start by calling [CreateConnection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_CreateConnection.html)\. This establishes a connection between App Runner and the GitHub organization or account\. For more information about App Runner connections, see [Managing App Runner connections](manage-connections.md)\.

Your service creation starts if the call returns a successful response with a [Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_Service.html) object showing `"Status": "CREATING"`\.

For an example call, see [Create a source code repository service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_CreateService.html#API_CreateService_Example_1) in the *AWS App Runner API Reference*

### Create a service from an Amazon ECR image<a name="manage-create.create.ecr"></a>

The following sections show how to create an App Runner service when your source is a container image stored in [Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/)\. Amazon ECR is an AWS service\. Therefore, to create a service based on an Amazon ECR image, you provide App Runner with an access role containing the necessary Amazon ECR action permissions\.

**Note**  
An access role isn't required if your image is stored in Amazon ECR Public, where images are publicly available\.

During service creation, App Runner launches a service that runs a container instance of the image you provide\. There is no build phase in this case\.

For more information, see [App Runner service based on a source image](service-source-image.md)\.

#### Creating a service from an image using the App Runner API or AWS CLI<a name="manage-create.create.ecr.api"></a>

To create a service using the App Runner API or AWS CLI, call the [CreateService](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_CreateService.html) API action\.

Your service creation starts if the call returns a successful response with a [Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_Service.html) object showing `"Status": "CREATING"`\.

For an example call, see [Create a source image repository service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_CreateService.html#API_CreateService_Example_2) in the *AWS App Runner API Reference*

## When service creation fails<a name="manage-create.failure"></a>

If your attempt to create an App Runner service fails, the service shows a status of `CREATE_FAILED` \(**Create failed** on the console\)\.

Your attempt to create a service might fail because of issues in your application code, build process, or configuration, because you reached resource quotas, or because of temporary issues with the underlying AWS services that your service needs to use\. To troubleshoot a failure, we recommend that you take the following actions\. First, read the service events and logs to find out what caused the failure\. Next, make any necessary changes to your code or configuration\. Last, delete one or more services if you reached your service quota\. Then, after completing all these steps, try creating the service again\.

**Important**  
The failed service isn't usable\. You don't incur any additional charges for it beyond the initial creation attempt\. However, App Runner doesn't automatically delete the failed service, and it still counts towards your service quota\. When you're done analyzing the failure, make sure that you delete the failed service\.
