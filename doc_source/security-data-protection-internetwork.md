App Runner uses Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) to create boundaries between resources in your App Runner application and control traffic between them, your on\-premises network, and the internet\. For more information about Amazon VPC security, see [Internetwork traffic privacy in Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

For information about securing requests to App Runner using a VPC endpoint, see [Using App Runner with VPC endpoints](security-data-protection-vpce.md)\.
